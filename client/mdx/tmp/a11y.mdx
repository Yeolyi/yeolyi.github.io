## What is accessibility?

The practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those
using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

- Semantic HTML, which improves accessibility, also improves SEO, making your
  site more findable.
- Caring about accessibility demonstrates good ethics and morals, which improves
  your public image.
- Other good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more
  usable by other groups, such as mobile phone users or those on low network
  speed. In fact, everyone can benefit from many such improvements.
- Did we mention it is also the law in some places?

Some people might have difficulty making the exact hand movements required to
use a mouse, while others might be more severely affected, perhaps being
significantly paralyzed to the point where they need to use a head pointer to
interact with computers.

Designing with cognitive accessibility will lead to good design practices. They
will benefit everyone.

If however, you consider accessibility from the start of a project, the cost of
making most content accessible should be fairly minimal. Just like any other
bug, an accessibility problem becomes more expensive to fix the later it is
discovered.

Publish an accessibility statement on your site and engage with people having
problems.

For a start, the W3C has published a large and very detailed document that
includes very precise, technology-agnostic criteria for accessibility
conformance. These are called the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG)**, and they are not a short read by any means.

Web browsers make use of special accessibility APIs (provided by the underlying
operating system) that expose information useful for assistive technologies
(ATs). This information is structured in a tree of information called the
accessibility tree.

Where the native semantic information provided by the HTML elements in your web
apps falls down, you can supplement it with features from the WAI-ARIA
specification, which add semantic information to the accessibility tree to
improve accessibility.

## HTML: A good basis for accessibility

A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making sure the
correct Hypertext Markup Language elements are used for the correct purpose at
all times.

Don't use dashes if you can avoid it. Instead of writing 5-7, write 5 to 7.
Expand abbreviations — instead of writing Jan, write January. Expand acronyms,
at least once or twice, then use the \<abbr\> tag to describe them.

One key aspect of the accessibility of UI controls is that by default, browsers
allow them to be manipulated by the keyboard. In the rare to non-existent case
when you need to use a non-button element for a button, **use the button
role(이거 봐보자)** and implement all the default button behaviors, including
keyboard and mouse button support.

Basically, the tabindex attribute is primarily intended to allow tabbable
elements to have a custom tab order (specified in positive numerical order),
instead of just being tabbed through in their default source order.

- tabindex="0" — as indicated above, this value allows elements that are not
  normally tabbable to become tabbable. This is the most useful value of
  tabindex.
- tabindex="-1" — this allows not normally tabbable elements to receive focus
  programmatically, e.g., via JavaScript, or as the target of links.

You should make sure that your button and link text labels are understandable
and distinctive. Don't just use "Click here" for your labels, as screen reader
users sometimes get up a list of buttons and form controls.

```html
<p>
  Whales are really awesome creatures.
  <a href="whales.html">Find out more about whales</a>.
</p>
```

```html
<p>
  Whales are really awesome creatures. To find out more about whales,
  <a href="whales.html">click here</a>.
</p>
```

```html
Fill in your name: <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
```

```html
<div>
  <label for="name">Fill in your name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
</div>
```

Table headers are defined using \<th\> elements — you can also specify if they
are headers for rows or columns using the scope attribute. This gives you
complete groups of data that can be consumed by screen readers as single units.
The \<caption\> element and the \<table\> element's summary attribute both do
similar jobs — they act as alt text for a table, giving a screen reader user a
useful quick summary of the table's contents. The \<caption\> element is
generally preferred as it makes it's content accessible to sighted users too,
who might also find it useful. You don't really need both.

Whereas textual content is inherently accessible, the same cannot necessarily be
said for multimedia content.

```html
<img src="dinosaur.png" />

<img
  src="dinosaur.png"
  alt="A red Tyrannosaurus Rex: A two legged dinosaur standing upright like a human, with small arms, and a large head with lots of sharp teeth."
/>
```

이거 AI로 해도 유용할듯.

All information image conveys that a sited user can access and is relevant to
the context is what needs to be conveyed; nothing more. Keep it short, precise,
and useful.

If they are decorative, it is better to write an empty text as a value for alt
attribute (see Empty alt attributes) or to just include them in the page as CSS
background images. If possible you should use CSS to display images that are
only decorative.

If you do want to provide extra contextual information, you should put it in the
text surrounding the image, or inside a title attribute, as shown above. In this
case, most screen readers will read out the alt text, the title attribute, and
the filename. In addition, browsers display title text as tooltips when moused
over.

```html
<!-- This is especially useful if you want to use the same text as a label for multiple images — something that isn't possible with alt. -->
<img src="dinosaur.png" aria-labelledby="dino-label" />
<p id="dino-label">The Mozilla red Tyrannosaurus…</p>
```

안읽는다고 그러는데...

Links that open in a new tab or window via the target="\_blank" declaration and
links to whose href value points to a file resource should include an indicator
about the behavior that will occur when the link is activated.

People experiencing low vision conditions, who are navigating with the aid of
screen reading technology, or who have cognitive concerns may become confused
when the new tab, window, or application is opened unexpectedly.

```html
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikipedia.org/"
  >Wikipedia (opens in a new window)</a
>
```

If an icon is used in place of text to signify this kind of links behavior, make
sure it includes an alternate description.

Skip links are especially useful for people who navigate with the aid of
assistive technology such as switch control, voice command, or mouth sticks/head
wands, where the act of moving through repetitive links can be a laborious task.

Large amounts of interactive content—including anchors—placed in close visual
proximity to each other should have space inserted to separate them.

## CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices

the link receives a highlight when focused (e.g. via tabbing) or activated.

A high contrast ratio will also allow anyone using a smartphone or tablet with a
glossy screen to better read pages when in a bright environment, such as
sunlight.

Another tip is to not rely on color alone for signposts/information, as this
will be no good for those who can't see the color. Instead of marking required
form fields in red, for example, mark them **with an asterisk and in red**.

Another way to improve accessibility for non-semantic JavaScript-powered widgets
is to use WAI-ARIA to provide extra semantics for screen reader users.

The idea of unobtrusive JavaScript is that it should be used wherever possible
to enhance functionality, not build it in entirely.

- Providing client-side form validation, which alerts users to problems with
  their form entries quickly, without having to wait for the server to check the
  data. If it isn't available, the form will still work, but validation might be
  slower.
- Providing custom controls for HTML \<video\>s that are accessible to
  keyboard-only users, along with a direct link to the video that can be used to
  access it if JavaScript is not available (the default \<video\> browser
  controls aren't keyboard accessible in most browsers).

Form validation은 클라와 서버에서 모두 하는게 맞구나. 전자는 responsive UI를
위해, 후자는 전자가 바이패스될 수 있으니 안전을 위해.

We only do the validation when the form is submitted — this is so that we don't
update the UI too often and potentially confuse screen reader (and possibly
other) users:

Note: In this example, we are hiding and showing the error message box using
absolute positioning rather than another method such as visibility or display,
because it doesn't interfere with the screen reader being able to read content
from it. (role="alert")

## WAI-ARIA basics

WAI-ARIA is a technology that can help with such problems by adding in further
semantics that browsers and assistive technologies can recognize and use to let
users know what is going on.

기본 제공되는 datepicker등이 마음에 안들어 직접 구현했는데 The problem here is
that visually they work, but screen readers can't make any sense of what they
are at all, and their users just get told that they can see a jumble of elements
with no semantics to describe what they mean.

> WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet
> Applications) is a specification written by the W3C, defining a set of
> additional HTML attributes that can be applied to elements to provide
> additional semantics and improve accessibility wherever it is lacking.

States differ from properties in that properties don't change throughout the
lifecycle of an app, whereas states can change, generally programmatically via
JavaScript.

An important point about WAI-ARIA attributes is that they don't affect anything
about the web page, except for the information exposed by the browser's
accessibility APIs. **WAI-ARIA doesn't affect webpage structure, the DOM,
etc.,** although the attributes can be useful for selecting elements by CSS.

WAI-ARIA는 페이지상에 랜드마크(search, tablist...)를 만들거나, 컨텐츠가 바뀔 떄
알리거나, 기본 제공 요소 아닌거 쓸 때 키보드 접근성을 향상시키거나(tabindex),
아까 말한 것처럼 복잡한 UI만들 떄 뭐가 뭔지 나타내거나할 때 쓴다.

**You should only use WAI-ARIA when you need to! Ideally, you should always use
native HTML features to provide the semantics required by screen readers to tell
their users what is going on**.

### Signposts/Landmarks

따로 라벨을 넣을 UI가 아닐 떄 aria-label을 활용할 수도 있다.

form에 role을 넣으면 called out as a separate item, both when browsing through
the page, and in the Landmarks menu..

### Dynamic content updates

The problem is that modern web apps are often not just static text — they often
update parts of the page by fetching new content from the server and updating
the DOM. 이거 논문에 쓰면 좋을듯.

WAI-ARIA, fortunately, provides a useful mechanism to provide these alerts — the
aria-live property. Applying this to an element causes screen readers to read
out the content that is updated.
