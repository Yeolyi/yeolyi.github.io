The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did not find a
current representation for the
[target resource](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#target.resource) or is
not willing to disclose that one exists.

A 404 status code does not indicate whether this lack of representation is
temporary or permanent; the
[410 (Gone)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#status.410) status code is
preferred over 404 if the origin server knows, presumably through some
configurable means, that the condition is likely to be permanent.

A 404 response is heuristically cacheable; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by
the method definition or explicit cache controls see
[Section 4.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-4.2.2) of
[CACHING](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#CACHING)
